			  INSTALLING gOCR


INSTALLING BINARIES
-------------------
Be sure that you have all the libraries needed. To install a binary package,
do the following:

1. Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

	tar -xzf gocr[version].tar.gz

on older tar versions, the above line might not work. If so, try the following:

	gzip -cd gocr[version].tgz | tar -xf -

This creates the directory ./gocr[version] containing the source from
the main archive.

2. Change to gocr directory and run make (use GNU Make).

	cd gocr[version]; make install

That's it.

INSTALLING FROM SOURCE 
----------------------

Requirements
------------
You'll need a compiler; we recommend gcc, but the code should compile in any
good one. gcc is available at http://gcc.gnu.org. I had some problems with gcc
2.95.1 (it consumed a LOT of memory while compiling ocr0.c). 2.95.2 seems to
be better.

gOCR provides some simple functions to read/write pnm archives. Though not 
needed, we strongly suggest, however, that you install the NetPBM package. Its
official URL is: http://download.sourceforge.net/netpbm/.

Installing this package will add support to many different image formats. 
If you have a NetPBM version older than August 2000, we suggest that you
download a more recent one, to take advantage of the new PAM functions.

Depending on your distribution you may use 
  yum install netpbm-devel        # red-hat like
or
  apt-get install libnetpbm10-dev # debian like
to get the necessary netpbm sources.

To create some of the examples provided, you'll need transfig.
This is completely optional.

Procedure
---------
1. Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

	tar -xzf gocr[version].tar.gz

on older tar versions, the above line might not work. If so, try the following:

	gzip -cd gocr[version].tgz | tar -xf -

This creates the directory ./gocr[version] containing the source from
the main archive.

2. Change to gocr directory and run configure.

	cd gocr[version]; ./configure

For a list of options, try ./configure --help.
If something goes wrong, try to run autoconf.

3. Run make (GNU Make). This can take a while.

	make

4. gOCR comes with some examples, which are generated from xfig-files.
   If you have transfig installed, you can make them:

	make examples

5. Install the binaries. You may need to do this as root.

	make install

6. Run gocr, or the frontend you chose.

	gocr -h			Shows help
	gocr.tcl		Runs Tcl GUI
